Absolutely! We have a great foundation with Prisma, Auth.js, and our UI components. 

[INSTRUCTIONS]
- We use shadcn components to build our design system
- Do not make any drastic, breaking changes without checking with the human agent
- We use yarn as our preferred package manager
- When in doubt, check the codebase to get more context on exising implementations

Let's plan Sprint 2 focusing on event mutations:

1. **Create Event Flow**
   - Form with rich validation
   - Image upload handling
   - Category selection
   - Date/time picker
   - Location/venue input
   - Price settings

2. **Update Event Flow**
   - Edit form reusing create components
   - Permission checks (only organizer can edit)
   - Image update handling
   - Status updates (active/cancelled)

3. **Delete Event Flow**
   - Soft delete vs hard delete consideration
   - Cascade handling (attendees, etc.)
   - Permission checks
   - Confirmation modal

4. **Event Management Dashboard**
   - List of user's created events
   - Event stats (views, registrations)
   - Bulk actions
   - Status filters

Would you like to start with the event creation flow first? We can begin by creating the form with proper validation using React Hook Form and Zod.
