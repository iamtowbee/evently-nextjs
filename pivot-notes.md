That's an interesting pivot! Let me share some thoughts on this direction:

Strengths of this approach:
1. **Growing Market**: Virtual/hybrid events are becoming more mainstream, not just a pandemic necessity
2. **Community Focus**: "Community for communities" is powerful - it can create network effects
3. **Lower Barriers**: No physical venue constraints or location limitations
4. **Data Rich**: Virtual events provide better analytics and engagement metrics
5. **Scalability**: Easier to scale virtual infrastructure than physical event management

Potential Features:
1. **Virtual Spaces**:
   - Customizable virtual rooms/halls
   - Different formats (webinar, roundtable, networking spaces)
   - Breakout rooms for smaller discussions

2. **Community Tools**:
   - Community profiles and directories
   - Interest-based matching
   - Discussion boards/forums between events
   - Community analytics and insights

3. **Event Features**:
   - Live streaming
   - Interactive polls/Q&A
   - Virtual networking rooms
   - Screen sharing/presentation tools
   - Recording and replay options

Technical Considerations:
1. **Video Solutions**:
   - Build on top of existing APIs (e.g., Twilio, Agora)
   - WebRTC for peer-to-peer connections
   - Consider latency and scalability needs

2. **Integration Options**:
   - Zoom/Meet/Teams integration for flexibility
   - Calendar integrations (Google, Outlook)
   - Social media sharing
